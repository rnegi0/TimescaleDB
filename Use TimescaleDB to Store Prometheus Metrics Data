# BASICS 

Prometheus is the leading open-source systems monitoring solution. With Prometheus, you can obtain metrics about your cloud infrastructure. 
Grafana is an open-source visualization engine, that enables you to gain powerful insight into your infrastructure metrics. 
TimescaleDB is a time-series database, providing the tools and services you need to store long-term infrastructure metrics and gain insight for cost-management, capacity planning, and root-cause analysis.

Together, TimescaleDB, Prometheus, and Grafana are an ideal open-source analytics stack.

# Why use a long-term store for Prometheus?
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that can be used to easily and cost-effectively monitor infrastructure and applications. You might be already familiar with it, especially if you use Kubernetes. Prometheus’ greatest advantage is its unapologetic approach to solving monitoring in a simple and straightforward way. Its philosophy is to do one thing, and do it well.

However, Prometheus is limited by design. As the Prometheus documentation says:

“[Prometheus] is not arbitrarily scalable or durable in the face of disk or node outages and should thus be treated as more of an ephemeral sliding window of recent data.”

Having both compute and data storage on one node keeps Prometheus simple and easy to operate. However, what this means is that Prometheus data can only stick around for so long, and is difficult to manage operationally, as there’s no replication or high-availability.

For this reason, fast, efficient, and cost-effective time-series databases like TimescaleDB are an essential component of a comprehensive monitoring stack.

Storing long-term metrics data gives you significant advantages over only examining real-time or recent data:

Manage costs. With insight into past and present metrics, you can determine the cost of doing business for various scenarios. How much does it cost to run your site on Black Friday? How much does it cost to add new sensors to your IoT infrastructure?
Plan capacity. You can understand how much infrastructure you will require to support various use cases.
Identify root causes. Having long-term views of metrics enables you to look for correlations when outages, degradation, or other periodic mishaps occur in your infrastructure.
